# Background Music Placeholder

This file represents where the background music would be stored. The actual audio file should be:
- A 20-second loop
- Soft, trippy, sci-fi ambient sound
- In MP3 and OGG formats for browser compatibility

The game will automatically generate background music using Web Audio API if this file is not available.

File should be named: background-music.mp3 (and background-music.ogg)
