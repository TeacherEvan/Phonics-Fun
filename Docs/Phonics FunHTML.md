2nd screen -  "Level Select" screen with the text: "Select a letter to play with!" in a fun, child-friendly font. The background should be colorful and engaging, with playful animations to capture the attention of young users. Below this text, there will be a row of clickable letters from A-Z. Each letter will be displayed in a large, bold font with vibrant colors. The letters will be arranged in a grid format for easy navigation.
The letters will be clickable, and when hovered over, they will change color to indicate interactivity
"Level select:" Followed by "A-Z" Clickable
but we will only focus on the letter "G" for now.
All letters except for "G" when interacted with will have a woody 'road sign' looking pop up displaying "COMING SOON!" If you click on "G" a pop screen displaying "READY??!!"  running for 5 seconds giving the backend time to load.

3rd screen -The 3rd window will be a exciting space themed ui where 5 different types of planets float across the screen with "The letter selected in the level select screen, however for now we will only be working with the letter "G". If the player touches any of the planet with "G" on, an astroid (5th of the size of the planet and on fire) comes from the side (Random side origin and fast) collides with the planet.
The planet then explodes in dramatic fashion Releasing a explosion sound followed by a sound: (Phonic of "G" - sounds like a low pitched "ghh" sound) and a sound is triggered of a female voice saying "Ghu is for Goat!", or "Ghu is for Grandpa!" or "ghu is for Gold!" or "gHu is for Girl" In the background in transparent a big image (Automatically adjust display depending on the image)
The image will appear in the background as the voice read it out lou while saying its phonic twice. So if "grape" is triggered it appear in the background transparent and a sound is played "Grape! gHuh -Ghu Grape, and so on for all 5 images in that will fall in the G" class. 
The large transparent image of a grape (Or whichever image is triggered) will be displayed in the background until the player successfully interacts with another planet that has the letter G displayed on it. To make it easier for the player, the letter "G" (or whatever level/alphabet symbol the player chose in the "Level select" screen) will be pulsating in light to dark yellow colors to indicate the letter they are currently playing with. All other letters will be clearly displayed on other planets floating on the main screen but when they are interacted with an astroid that is dull and slow is shot out from the side (random side origin) and collides with the planet, but no explosion or sound effect will occur. The dull asteroid will simply break apart and disappear whilst the planet remains untouched.

Gameplay will be in phases of 5 planets. After all planets have been/destroyed, a pop-up will appear saying "Level Complete!" with a celebratory sound effect. The player can then click "Next Level" to return to the Level Select screen or "Exit" to return to the Welcome Screen. Along side the 5 planets, there will be a large background image of a galaxy to enhance the space theme. The background will be static but visually appealing, with stars and planets to create an immersive experience.
and 5 other planets displaying other letters that will be clearly visible but not interactive. The planets will be designed to be visually distinct, with different colors and styles to make them easily recognizable..

## Development Guidelines
- **Code Organization**: Use multiple folders to organize the codebase, separating HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and sounds for better maintainability.
